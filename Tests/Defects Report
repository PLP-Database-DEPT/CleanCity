Defects Report for index.html
1. Accessibility Issues
Missing ARIA attributes: No ARIA roles or labels for navigation, forms, or error messages. This may hinder screen reader users.
Form error messages: Error <div>s (e.g., id="waste-error") are not associated with their respective inputs using aria-describedby.
Image alt attributes: Images in the Awareness section lack alt attributes, which is required for accessibility.
Label association: Some labels (e.g., for radio buttons) do not use for attributes, which can reduce accessibility.

2. Form Validation and Usability
Client-side validation: No evidence of client-side validation for required fields beyond the HTML required attribute. No JavaScript validation for matching passwords or email format.
Password requirements: The password field hints at a minimum length but does not enforce it in the HTML (minlength attribute missing).
No feedback on successful/failed form submission: Success and error messages are present but hidden by default; unclear if they are shown on actual submission. 

3. Semantic HTML
Improper use of headings: Some sections use <h2> and <h3> out of order, which can confuse screen readers and affect SEO.
Non-semantic containers: Many <div>s are used where more semantic elements (like <section>, <main>, <aside>) could improve structure.

4. Security Concerns
Password fields: No autocomplete="new-password" or autocomplete="current-password" attributes on password fields.
Demo credentials: Demo accounts are shown on the login page, which is fine for a demo but should be removed for production.

5. User Experience
No loading indicators: No feedback for users during async operations (e.g., form submission, dashboard loading).
No error handling for network failures: No indication of how errors are handled if the backend is unreachable.

6. Code Organization
Inline JavaScript: The script is loaded at the end, but all logic is in script.js. Consider modularizing for maintainability.
Repeated code: Error message <div>s are repeated for each form field; could be abstracted for DRYness.

7. Other Issues
Hardcoded contact info: Contact information is hardcoded in the Awareness section; consider externalizing for easier updates.
No favicon: No favicon is set for the site.
Recommendation:
Address accessibility and validation issues first, as these directly impact user experience and inclusivity. Then, improve semantic structure and security best practices.
