## DEF-002

**Title:**

**Detected By:**  
Manual Accessibility Testing (axe DevTools)

**Date Reported:**  
_2025-07-07_

**Related Test Case(s):**  
[TC-MK-001]

**Environment:**  
- Local React App (`npm start`)  
- Browser: Chrome  
- Tool: axe DevTools v4.10.3

**Description:**

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Start the app locally with `npm start`.  
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/blog`.  
3. Open Chrome DevTools ‚Üí go to **axe DevTools** tab.  
4. Click **"Analyze"**.  
5. Observe the issue: ‚ÄúPage should contain one `<h1>` heading‚Äù.

**Expected Behavior:**  
- The Blog page should include a unique `<h1>` element near the top of its main content section.

**Actual Behavior:**  
- No `<h1>` found; page structure begins with `<h3>` or styled `<div>`s instead.

**Severity:**  
Medium ‚Äî Affects accessibility and WCAG compliance.

**Status:**
