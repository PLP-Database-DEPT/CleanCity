# Comprehensive Test Report for CleanCity

## 1. Executive Summary

This report summarizes the results of the quality assurance testing performed on the CleanCity web application. The testing was conducted between [Start Date] and [End Date].

The application was tested for functional and non-functional requirements, and several critical bugs and security vulnerabilities were identified. The most critical issues are related to the application's core functionality, such as user registration, login, and waste pickup scheduling.

Overall, the application is not ready for production due to the high number of critical issues. It is recommended that the development team addresses these issues before the application is released to the public.

## 2. Test Strategy and Approach

The testing was performed manually. The testing process was divided into the following phases:
- Test planning
- Test design
- Test execution
- Test closure

## 3. Test Environment Details

- **Application URL:** http://localhost:3000
- **Browsers:** N/A (Testing was performed in a command-line environment)
- **Devices:** N/A (Testing was performed in a command-line environment)

## 4. Test Execution Summary

The testing was focused on the following areas:
- User registration
- User login
- Waste pickup scheduling
- Accessibility
- Security

## 5. Defect Analysis and Categorization

A total of 7 defects were found during the testing. The defects are categorized by severity as follows:
- **Critical:** 4
- **High:** 1
- **Medium:** 1
- **Minor:** 1

The following is a list of the defects found:
- **BUG-001 (Critical):** Registration form does not create a new user.
- **BUG-002 (Critical):** Login form does not perform any authentication.
- **BUG-003 (Critical):** Waste pickup scheduling form does not submit the request.
- **BUG-004 (Minor):** Redundant `role` attribute on `article` elements.
- **BUG-005 (Critical):** Passwords are stored in plain text.
- **BUG-006 (High):** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in `getUserById`.
- **BUG-007 (Medium):** User enumeration vulnerability in `getUserByEmail`.

## 6. Risk Assessment

The most significant risks associated with the application are the security vulnerabilities. The fact that passwords are stored in plain text and that the application is vulnerable to IDOR and user enumeration attacks makes it very insecure.

The functional bugs are also a major risk, as they prevent the users from using the application's core features.

## 7. Recommendations and Improvements

It is recommended that the development team addresses all the identified issues before the application is released. The following are the most important recommendations:
- Implement a proper user registration and authentication system.
- Fix the waste pickup scheduling functionality.
- Hash the user passwords before storing them in the database.
- Implement proper authorization checks to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities.
- Implement a mechanism to prevent user enumeration attacks.

## 8. Test Metrics and KPIs

- **Total Defects:** 7
- **Critical Defects:** 4
- **High Defects:** 1
- **Medium Defects:** 1
- **Minor Defects:** 1
- **Test Case Pass Rate:** 0% (All test cases related to the identified bugs failed)
